Especially when comparing Bayesian Hierarchical models to Black-Litterman, requires a structured approach that ensures robustness, significance, and practical applicability. Here's a guide on how you can create a rigorous comparison between the two:

1. **Define the Objective Clearly**:
    - Start with a clear research question, such as: "Which model provides better out-of-sample portfolio performance: Bayesian Hierarchical or Black-Litterman?"
    - Define "better" in quantifiable terms: Sharpe ratio, maximum drawdown, cumulative return, etc.

2. **Data Preparation**:
    - As you mentioned, you'll train on data from 2018 to 2022 and test on data from 2023.
    - Ensure data is clean, free of missing values, and has consistent data types.

3. **Black-Litterman Model**:
    - Create the views. You can create static views based on data till 2022. It's crucial to ensure these views are as objective and unbiased as possible.
    - Optimize the portfolio using these views and obtain weights for 2023.
    - Measure performance on the test set.

4. **Bayesian Hierarchical Model**:
    - Model your returns using a hierarchical approach where ETFs within the same sector might share similarities.
    - A popular Python library for Bayesian methods is `PyMC3`. Use it to construct the Bayesian Hierarchical model.
    - This model will give you posterior distributions of returns for each ETF. Use these distributions to optimize your portfolio for 2023.
    - Measure performance on the test set.

5. **Comparison**:
    - With the portfolios optimized by both methods, you can now compare their performance in 2023.
    - Compare on multiple metrics: total returns, volatility, maximum drawdown, Sharpe ratio, etc.
    - Use statistical tests, like the t-test or Wilcoxon signed-rank test, to check if the performance differences are statistically significant.

6. **Discussion & Further Enhancements**:
    - Discuss the potential reasons one model might have outperformed the other.
    - Consider the practical implications: Which model is more sensitive to input changes? Which is easier for portfolio managers to understand and implement?
    - Suggest and possibly implement further enhancements. For instance, can you incorporate macroeconomic indicators or alternative data into either model to improve forecasts?

7. **Validation**:
    - Besides the primary test set, consider performing rolling window validation or other forms of time series cross-validation to ensure robustness.
    - Check model assumptions. For Bayesian models, posterior predictive checks can be insightful.

8. **Conclusion & Recommendations**:
    - Summarize your findings.
    - Provide clear recommendations for portfolio managers or investors: Which model should they consider? Under what conditions?

9. **Presentation & Documentation**:
    - Visualize your results. Graphs comparing cumulative returns, distributions of returns, etc., can be very powerful.
    - Document your methodologies, assumptions, and codes meticulously. Your methodology's reproducibility is a mark of a high-quality project.

10. **Feedback & Peer Review**:
    - Before finalizing, get feedback. If possible, have finance and machine learning experts review your work. Their feedback can be invaluable in refining and enhancing your project.

Remember, while the project's technical rigor is essential, the ability to convey your findings and insights in a clear and actionable manner to your target audience (like Fintech companies and consultancy firms, as per your profile) is just as crucial.
